# 2016-cami-pipeline

[@abremges](https://github.com/abremges) proposes the publication of the [metagenome simulation pipeline](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/MetagenomeSimulationPipeline) as two back-to-back publications in the journal [*GigaScience*](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/):
  1. [Research Article](./1_research_article.md), describing the pipeline implementation and design motivation 
  1. [Data Note](./2_data_note.md), specifying the concrete datasets used in the first CAMI challenge

This way, we can decouple implementation efforst and data generation, and we get two publications for the price of one (different co-authors).

Plus, we have found a long-term archival solution for the simulated sequencing reads (that we may not submit elsewhere): *GigaScience*'s [GigaDB](http://gigadb.org/).
